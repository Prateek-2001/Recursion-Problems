 We shall convert the bottle numbers into Binary 

 Bottle 1 =  000000001
 Bottle 1000 = 1111101000

 The prisoners 1 to 10 will drink from bottles with the bit in the same number position as they are;
 Prisoner 1 will drink from all bottles whose least significant bit is 1 and so forth will every other prisoner.
This will help in deducing which bottle has the poison depending on which prisoner were to die.
